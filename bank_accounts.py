Bank Account Management System

This program defines a simple banking system with different types of accounts. It allows users to:
- Create bank accounts.
- Deposit and withdraw money.
- Transfer money between accounts.
- Handle insufficient balance cases using custom exceptions.
- Implement interest rewards for deposits.
- Introduce savings accounts with withdrawal fees.

Classes:
1. `BalanceException`: Custom exception for handling insufficient balance.
2. `BankAccount`: Base class for a general bank account.
3. `InterestRewardsAccount`: Inherits from `BankAccount` and adds a 5% interest on deposits.
4. `SavingsAccount`: Inherits from `InterestRewardsAccount` and introduces a withdrawal fee.
